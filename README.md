# Velocity template langue syntax files.
This is some very basic install and set up instructions. If you want to jump in a help develop this more take a look at the [Syntax Definitions](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html) devlopement documentation put together by the Sublime crew. That should be able to get you started. Happy codeing.
