# Velocity template langue syntax files.
This is some very basic install and set up instructions.
If you want to jump in a help develop this more. Take a look at the [Syntax Definitions](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html) documentation put together by the [Sublime](http://sublimetext.info/) crew. Its a pretty sweet collection and should be able to get you started. Happy codeing.
